# Customer Crisis

A customer has come to us with a problem. They went to "The Coding Cowboyz" and paid them to complete a product for them. However, what they got back was not a working product. See if you can help them out by finding and fixing the bugs in the program.

## Product Specification

This is the spec the customer used to get the software created.

```
Requirements:
- We want a game where a player takes a guess at a number between 1 and 10
- You should keep score, and if a player guesses correctly, you should add to the score
- You should ask the player if they want to continue the game, and keep playing until they refuse
```

## Team Requests

You should follow our bug hunting procedure exactly. Namely:

- Once you've found a bug, open an issue in your GitHub repo describing the bug. Make sure to tag it with the `bug` tag. Make a note of the issue number, e.g. `#12`
- Go ahead and fix the bug
- Once it is fixed you should add and commit to git with a message including the phrase `"fixes <insert commit number here>"`, e.g. `"fixes #12"`
- Keep going until all the functionality is how it should be
